# Subtitle-Generator

The YouTube Subtitle Generator is a Python-based tool that converts speech from video files into subtitles. Built using Tkinter for the graphical interface, MoviePy for extracting audio, and SpeechRecognition for speech-to-text conversion, this tool provides a quick way to generate subtitles in .srt format for YouTube videos.

Users can select any supported video file format (e.g., .mp4, .mkv, .avi) through the GUI, and the tool automatically extracts the audio and processes it to generate subtitles. The resulting .srt file can be directly uploaded to YouTube for accurate captioning.
